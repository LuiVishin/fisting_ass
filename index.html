            <h1>Spider-Man</h1>
            <p>
                Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-
                editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko.
                He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
                Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic
                Books. He appears in American comic books published
                by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies,
                television shows, and video game adaptations set
                in the Marvel Universe. In the stories, Spider-Man
                is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his
                Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after
                his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in
                a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
                with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues,
                and accompanied him with many supporting characters,
                such as J. Jonah Jameson, Flash Thompson,
                Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary
                Jane Watson, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, Green
                Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring
                spider-related abilities after a bite from a
                radioactive spider; these include clinging to
                surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted
                devices, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense".
